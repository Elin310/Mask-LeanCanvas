# Lean Canvas

## Problem
> List your top 1-3 problems.

1. The existing products on the market is very expensive
2. Measures from, for example, pulswatches can be inaccurate
3. Continous measurements during activity can be hard 

### Existing Alternatives
> List how these problems are solved today.

1. VO2 Master can do metabolic measurements during activity but is quite expensive
2. Smart watches / Wearables

## Customer Segments
> List your target customer and users.

1. Hospitals
2. Research centers
3. Athletes
4. Trainers
5. Private customers

### Early Adopters
> List the characteristics of your ideal customer.

A patient that could benefit from continous or regulatory Co2 (and more) measures at home to determine wheter the patien't condition has worsened
 
Universities involved in sports technology 
 
## Unique Value Proposition
> Single, clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth paying attention.

Home non invasive metabolic measurements accessible to all!

Unlike wearables that only estimate VO2 max values, our mask will measure the O2 and CO2 exchange at a lab level for accuracy, for a fraction of the cost. 


### High-level Concept
> List your X for Y analogy e.g. Youtube = Flickr for videos

VO2 Master, but developed for students and researchers - portable and affordable for education at KTH.


## Solution
> Outline a possible solution for each problem.

Build a cheaper version but with the same features.

Direct measurement via exhaled air

Create possibilities for wireless measurement and transfer of data
 
## Channels
> List your path to customers (inbound or outbound).

1. KTH innovations
2. Collaboration with Research centers
3. Congress and exhibitions for hospital market

## Revenue Streams
> List your sources of revenue.

1. Direct purchases
2. Research grants
3. B2B offers with hospitals, clinics, and training centers. 

## Cost Structure
> List your fixed and variable costs.

1. Spareparts
2. Staff
3. Exhibition costs
4. Testing and certification of approval for clinical use.  

## Key Metrics

> List the key numbers that tell you how your business is doing.

1. More accessible healthcare
2. Prototype completion/Usable product
3. Sensor accuracy

## Unfair Advantage
